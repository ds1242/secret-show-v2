## Story
A user is wanting to host an “underground” show without booking a formal venue. They jump on our app, create an account and then build a show page by inputting all their relevant information into prebuilt fields to create a show. Upon a button click a web page is created with their band name, show details, an image, a youtube video, an interactive map to the location of the show as well as a log of views on the page. Their show is then added to our “Upcoming Shows” where users can browse and share shows. Users also have the ability to edit or delete their shows.
